This is a code to obtain the solution of an NQueens problem using a modified version of the Genetic Algorithm. I have developed this code based on the technique presented in Marko Božiković, Marin Golub, Leo Budin "Solving n-Queen problem using global parallel genetic algorithm" EUROCON 2003 Ljubljana, Slovenia.
